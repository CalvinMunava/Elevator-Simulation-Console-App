# Elevator Simulation Console App

## Welcome to the Elevator Simulation Console App! This project simulates the operation of elevators within a building. It allows users to call elevators to specific floors, simulate elevator movement, and manage elevator queues.
Features

    Call Elevator: Users can call an elevator to a specified floor, indicating the number of passengers and the destination floor.
    Simulate Movement: The app simulates the movement of elevators between floors, including opening and closing doors, and moving passengers.
    Queue Management: If no elevator is available, calls are added to a queue and processed when elevators become available.
    Multi Threading :  

## Getting Started

## Follow these steps to run the Elevator Simulation Console App:

    Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine.

    Build the Solution: Open the solution file (ElevatorSimulation.sln) in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE. Build the solution to ensure all dependencies are resolved.

    Run the Application: Start the application by running the ElevatorSimulation project. This will launch the console app in your terminal or command prompt.

    Use the Console Interface: Follow the instructions provided in the console interface to interact with the elevator simulation. You can call elevators, view their status, and exit the application.

## Architecture

## The Elevator Simulation Console App is built using C# and .NET Core. It consists of several key components:

    Elevator: Represents an elevator in the building, including its current state, capacity, and movement.
    BuildingManager: Manages the elevators within the building, including handling elevator calls and queue management.
    Console Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the elevator simulation via the console.

## Testing

Unit tests are included to ensure the functionality of critical components such as calling elevators and simulating elevator movement. You can run the tests using your preferred testing framework or directly from Visual Studio.
